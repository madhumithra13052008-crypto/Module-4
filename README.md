# Experiment No:4-A: Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the *area of a circle* based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named cse and a method mech to perform the calculation.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. *Get user input*: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. *Define the class*: Create a class named cse.
3. *Define the method*: Inside the class, define the method mech to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. *Execute the program*: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
import math as m
class pen:
    def stationary(self,a):
        self.a=a
    def f(self):
        print(f"Area of circle: {self.a*self.a*m.pi:.2f}")
d=int(input())
s=pen()
s.stationary(d)
s.f()
```

## Result
The program successfully calculates the area of a circle using classes and objects
# Experiment No:4-B: Dictionary Operations in Python: Merging Two Dictionaries

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that merges **two dictionaries** and combines their key-value pairs.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define two dictionaries `dict1` and `dict2` with some key-value pairs.
2. Define a function `merge()` that merges the two dictionaries using the `**` unpacking operator.
   - The merged result will combine keys from both dictionaries. If a key exists in both, the value from `dict2` will overwrite that from `dict1`.
3. Call the `merge()` function and print the merged dictionary.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
dict1=eval(input())
dict2=eval(input())
dict1.update(dict2)
print(dict1)
```

## Output

## Result
The program successfully merges two dictionaries.
All key-value pairs from both dictionaries are combined.
If a key exists in both dictionaries (like 'b'), the value from the second dictionary (dict2) overwrites the value from the first dictionary (dict1).
# Experiment No:4-C: Dictionary-Python Program to Sort a Dictionary by Keys and Values

This Python program demonstrates how to sort a dictionary:
- Alphabetically by keys
- Alphabetically by values

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that sorts a dictionary's:
- Keys in alphabetical order
- Values in alphabetical order

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. *Start the program.*
2. *Define* a dictionary with key-value pairs.
3. *Sort by Keys*:
   - Use sorted(dictionary.items())
   - Convert the result to a dictionary using dict()
4. *Sort by Values*:
   - Use sorted(dictionary.items(), key=lambda item: item[1])
   - Convert the result to a dictionary using dict()
5. *Display* the original and sorted dictionaries.
6. *End the program.*

---

## ðŸ§ªProgram
```
d={1:2, 5:12, 6:18, 4:24, 2:56, 3:323}
sorted_items=sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
print("Keys and Values sorted in alphabetical order by the value")
print(sorted_items)
```

## Result
The program successfully sorts a dictionary
# Experiment No:4-D: Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `list1` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[5]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"You're out of list range"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
Add code here
```
lst=[5, 10, 20]

try:
    print(lst[5])
except IndexError:
   print("You're out of list range")
```

## Result
The program successfully handles an IndexError when attempting to access a list element beyond its range.
Instead of crashing, it prints a custom message, informing the user that the requested index is out of range.
# Experiment No:4-E: File Handling in Python: Count Lines Not Starting with 'T'

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that counts the number of lines in a text file story.txt that do *not* start with the alphabet 'T'.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Open the file story.txt in *read mode*.
2. Initialize a counter count to zero.
3. Iterate through each line of the file:
   - Check if the first character of the line is *not* 'T'.
   - If the line does not start with 'T', increment the count by 1.
4. After processing all lines, print the count value, which represents the number of lines that do not start with 'T'.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def create_file(file_path, content):
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        file.write(content)
def print_lines_with_substring(file_path, substring):
    with open(file_path,'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if substring in line:
                print(line.strip())
```
